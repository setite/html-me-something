    <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>So, to explain my journey as a
        coder, I must state that I hate(d) code. I have been exposed to code when I was
        a kid using Linux because my allowance didn’t allow for upgrades to keep up
        with planned obsolescence, when I had to learn how to modify drivers for stuff
        to work. At least in my mind this was coding, and it was a nightmare. I was
        exposed to code when I was when I got tired of grinding in World of Warcraft
        and started botting, using C# so that I was essentially a higher level of
        script-kiddie. But most important is that I knew just enough code and IT skills
        to be dangerous, and so I broke my computers way more than was reasonable and I
        learned to fix them but also grew to distrust computer science.</p>
        <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Enter University.</p>
        
        <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>In University I chose a degree in Industrial-Organizational
        Psychology, a fancy name for work psychology. As this degree was, at one point,
        called Quantitative Psychology there was a lot of statistical analysis
        involved. That is how I became a reluctant coder. I like statistics and
        initially learned the minimum code necessary to operate the existing algorithms
        but this very simple scripting and function writing, like Pythons purpose in
        LC101, gave me a taste of how easy coding had become relative to my earlier
        experiences. I discovered that I like statistics and wanted to do more and so I
        went the extra step to learn R. If you don’t know R, it’s basically a high-level
        language, designed specifically for statistical coding and competes with Python
        in the Data Science space. I later discovered that it differs from most languages
        in a single way, it’s Base 1 instead of Base 0.</p>
        
        <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>So, I realized a little late, but
        not too late, that I should have gotten a CS degree. I am a formerly-reluctant
        coder who has a lot of self-taught coding experience (R/C#/JavaScript/HTML and
        I think I learned like 5 minutes of BASIC when I was a kid) but nothing I can
        show on a resume and frankly I could use some of the foundation I skipped.
        LC101 was the answer because I don’t want to pay 10-15k$ for a bootcamp but I
        am also likely to put off self-learning and developing a GitHub portfolio.</p>
