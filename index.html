    <p>So, to explain my journey as a
    coder, I must state that I hate(d) code. I have been exposed to code when I was
    a kid using Linux because my allowance didn’t allow for upgrades to keep up
    with planned obsolescence, when I had to learn how to modify drivers for stuff
    to work. At least in my mind this was coding, and it was a nightmare. I was
    exposed to code when I was when I got tired of grinding in World of Warcraft
    and started botting, using C# so that I was essentially a higher level of
    script-kiddie. But most important is that I knew just enough code and IT skills
    to be dangerous, and so I broke my computers way more than was reasonable and I
    learned to fix them but also grew to distrust computer science.</p>
    
    <p>In University I chose a degree in Industrial-Organizational
    Psychology, a fancy name for work psychology. As this degree was, at one point,
    called Quantitative Psychology there was a lot of statistical analysis
    involved. That is how I became a reluctant coder. I like statistics and
    initially learned the minimum code necessary to operate the existing algorithms
    but this very simple scripting and function writing, like Pythons purpose in
    LC101, gave me a taste of how easy coding had become relative to my earlier
    experiences. I discovered that I like statistics and wanted to do more and so I
    went the extra step to learn R. If you don’t know R, it’s basically a high-level
    language, designed specifically for statistical coding and competes with Python
    in the Data Science space. I later discovered that it differs from most languages
    in a single way, it’s Base 1 instead of Base 0.</p>
    
    <p>So, I realized a little late, but
    not too late, that I should have gotten a CS degree. I am a formerly-reluctant
    coder who has a lot of self-taught coding experience (R/C#/JavaScript/HTML and
    I think I learned like 5 minutes of BASIC when I was a kid) but nothing I can
    show on a resume and frankly I could use some of the foundation I skipped.
    LC101 was the answer because I don’t want to pay 10-15k$ for a bootcamp and I
    am also likely to put off self-learning and developing a GitHub portfolio.</p>

        Isn't that a cool picture someone made turning the Arch into a 
    Stargate?</p>
    <p><img src = 'Janefrigginfriends.gif' height = "200px" class="img_generic" alt = "Jane Lane has no friends"/>
       This is a great gif that shows off my favorite American cartoon and also 
    signals the fact that I am a bit of a loner. I am not anti-social by any means
    but I'm not from St. Louis. Making friends as an adult can be weird in a normal
    town but the St. Louis dynamics are special. So much so that I've read articles
    about it and there are companies that specialize in helping St. Louis transplants
    network and make friends.

    At this point I am just adding pictures to have extra content. This gif and the
    one below it come from my favorite anime, Swort Art Online.
